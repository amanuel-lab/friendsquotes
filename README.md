Well during my second assignment I chose to build an api site which was a little harder than the other choices but wanted to challenge my self.
I learned a lot about javascript trying to connect my code to the .Json file that you provided to us. After a lot of digging and frustration it finally worked.
The other thing I found challenging was trying to make it responsive to a phone or a smaller screen I tried my best but I couldn't fix it for now
Thanks very much
